description: Get started with Turso and Python using the libSQL client in a few simple steps
---

In this Python quickstart we will learn how to:

- Install the Python libSQL client
- Connect to a remote Turso database
- Execute a query using SQL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install libsql-client library">

    First begin by installing the `libsql-client` [library](https://pypi.org/project/libsql-client/):

    ```python
    pip3 install libsql-client
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialize a new client">

    ```python
    url = "libsql://"
    client = libsql_client.create_client_sync(url, auth_token=token)
    ```

    The url can either be a local file or a remote turso database.
    The client used in this example is the synchronous version. The async version can also be used in conjunction with `asyncio`. Learn more [here](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-experimental-python/blob/main/docs/api.md).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Execute a query using SQL">
    ```python
    result_set = client.execute('SELECT * FROM Users')
    for row in result_set.rows:
        print(row)
    ```
    </Step>
